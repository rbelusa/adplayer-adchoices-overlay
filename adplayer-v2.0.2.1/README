Getting Started
=================================================================================

Importing AdPlayer Project into Eclipse
-----------------------------------------

1) File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace
2) Check "Select root directory"
2) Click Browse and select the GIT repository, which should already be cloned
   to the system.
3) Ensure the directory is selected under the "Projects" section.
4) Click "Finish"
5) Project should be imported to current workspace


Building AdPlayer Project
-----------------------------------------
1) Right click "build.xml" > Run As > Ant Build
2) A new "build" directory will be created containing the Ant build output.
3) Note: Eclipse may require you to refresh the project folder's view. This can
   be done easily by right clicking the project folder and clicking "Refresh."

Demo Test
------------------------------------------
A demo test page still needs to be created. This will be created soon. 
The Demo test will demonstrate the main Advert serving scenarios:
- Javascript Tag Delivery
- Friendly IFrame Delivery
- Non-Friendly IFrame Delivery 

QUnit Testing
-----------------------------------------
The Adplayer methods needs to be tested in different browsers. The current qunit 
test test the following:
- $ADP.Util.JSON   The JSON object will use the native or a fallback JSON class 
  and this needs to be tested as it is used for browser messaging
  
1) Execute "ant tests" in the project directory, this will buils and create a 
   symlink to the built Adplayer-x.x.x.js file
2) Open tests/index.html in your browser and view the result of the qunit test
